These sprites had been made to participate in the game jam: "weekly-game-jam-278_Week 278 Theme: Microscopic"; but I didn't get ready for the game jam; so I share the assets of the game.

Contains ideal sprites for a turn-based RPG game like pokemon or Final Fantasy:
-Bacteria and virus sprites
-Character sprite
-Icons and miscellaneous
